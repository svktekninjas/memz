This is a test file for the Knowledge Base system.

It contains several paragraphs of text to ensure that the system can properly process and chunk content.

The Knowledge Base should be able to:
1. Read this file
2. Extract the content
3. Split it into chunks if necessary
4. Store it in the vector database
5. Make it searchable

This is another paragraph with some technical information. The system uses embeddings to convert text into vector representations that can be searched semantically.

Final paragraph to test the chunking algorithm and ensure everything is working correctly with the Knowledge Base ingestion process.
